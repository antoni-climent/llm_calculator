# llm_calculator 
 The llm extracts the information needed from the prompt to execute by code a simple operation such as adding or multiplying.
 It is a toy demo to test this aplication of llms :joystick: 

 We are using the open source llm zephyr that is executed locally to extract the parameters needed to perform the operation by making it output the response in a json format, that then is used to perform the calculation by code.
